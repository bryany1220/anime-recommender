# anime-recommender

Using Python, NumPy, SciPy, and Pandas, I used an older API from myAnimeList and made an anime recommendation system using Yonatan Rabinovich's template on Kaggle as a guide since this is my very first data science project. Check it out here: https://www.kaggle.com/code/yonatanrabinovich/anime-recommendations-project/notebook
I made some slight adjustments and tweaks to the code to accommodate movie recommendations and the number of recommendations, but this did give me more practice with Python and its numerous libraries and functions. I also learned how to clean data and create pivot tables, something which is very useful for someone who is learning data science, like me.
